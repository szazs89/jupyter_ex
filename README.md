# jupyter_ex
Example notebooks for Jupyter platform

After logging in at jupyterhub (or starting your own jupyter-notebook) the browser window shows 3 tabs:

|Files |Running |IPython Clusters |
|------|--------|-----------------|

* __Files__ shows the home directory with a __[New>]__ button in the right-top corner.
* __Running__ shows the active notebooks and terminals.
* __IPython Clusters__ shows the started nodes for parallel computations.

Clicking on the __[New>]__ button one can
* create a new Python or Julia (or ...?) notebook,
* open a new terminal window on the server,
* create a simple text file (the syntax highlight scheme can be also chosen at the Language menu),
* make a new folder in the filesystem.
