# jupyter_ex
_Example notebooks for Jupyter platform_

After logging in at jupyterhub...
now the UI of jupyterlab welcomes us.
The Launcher Tab shows the available notebook formats, etc.

The left-bar makes accessible
* the filesystem tree,
* the kernel and terminal management,
* the git version controlling,
* the command list,
* the list of open tabs.

The Logout is available from the _Hub_ menu.

### (Obsoleted by jupyterlab UI)
...(or starting your own jupyter-notebook) the browser window shows 3 tabs:

|Files |Running |IPython Clusters |
|------|--------|-----------------|

* __Files__ shows the home directory with a __[New>]__ button in the right-top corner.
* __Running__ shows the active notebooks and terminals.
* __IPython Clusters__ shows the started nodes for parallel computations.

Clicking on the __[New>]__ button one can
* create a new Python or Julia (or ...?) notebook,
* open a new terminal window on the server,
* create a simple text file (the syntax highlight scheme can be also chosen at the Language menu),
* make a new folder in the filesystem.
